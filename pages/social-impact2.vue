          The history of Cambodian art stretches back centuries to ancient
          pottery, silk weaving, and stone carving. The height of Khmer art
          occurred during the Angkor period; much of the era's stone carving and
          architecture survives to the present. In pre-colonial Cambodia, art
          and crafts were generally produced either by rural non-specialists for
          practical use or by skilled artists producing works for the Royal
          Palace. In modern Cambodia, many artistic traditions entered a period
          of decline or even ceased to be practiced, but the country has
          experienced a recent artistic revival as the tourist market has
          increased and governments and NGOs have contributed to the
          preservation of Cambodian culture.

          Silk weaving in Cambodia has a long history. The practice dates to as
          early as the first century, and textiles were used in trade during
          Angkorian times. Even modern textile production evidences these
          historic antecedents: motifs found on silk today often echo clothing
          details on ancient stone sculptures.

          There are two main types of Cambodian weaving. The ikat technique
          (Khmer: chong kiet), which produces patterned fabric, is quite
          complex. To create patterns, weavers tie and dye portions of weft yarn
          before weaving begins. Patterns are diverse and vary by region; common
          motifs include lattice, stars, and spots. The second weaving
          technique, unique to Cambodia, is called "uneven twill". It yields
          single or two-color fabrics, which are produced by weaving three
          threads so that the "color of one

          Cambodia first started hand-weaving fabric in the 13th century. During
          the years of the Khmer Rouge era, a lot of the hand-weaving stopped
          production due to the political turmoil of the day. Since this period
          many organizations have worked to help Cambodia revive its hand
          weaving industry. Cambodia weaves three kinds of hand weaves such as
          IKAT, twills, and plain weaves. In the past, most fabrics woven has
          been 100% silk, but today Cambodia is starting to weave some
          interesting blended fabrics.

          Many Cambodian farmers weave baskets (Khmer: tbanh kantrak) for
          household use or as a supplemental source of income. Most baskets are
          many of thinly cut bamboo. Regions known for basketry include Siem
          Reap and Kampong Cham.[3] Mat weaving (tbanh kantuel) is a common
          seasonal occupation. They are most commonly made from reeds, either
          left a natural tan color or dyed in deep jewel tones. The region of
          Cambodia best-known for mat weaving is the Mekong floodplain,
          especially around Lvea Em district. Mats are commonly laid out for
          guests and are important building materials for homes.[4] Wicker and
          rattan crafts (tbanh kanchoeu) made from dryandra trees are also
          significant. Common wicker and rattan products include walls, mats,
          furniture, and other household items.

          Cambodia's best-known stone carving adorns the temples of Angkor,
          which are "renowned for the scale, richness and detail of their
          sculpture". In modern times, however, the art of stone carving became
          rare, largely because older sculptures survived undamaged for
          centuries (eliminating the need for replacements) and because of the
          use of cement molds for modern temple architecture. By the 1970s and
          1980s, the craft of stone carving was nearly lost.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the late 20th century, however, efforts to restore Angkor
          resulted in a new demand for skilled stone carvers to replace missing
          or damaged pieces, and a new tradition of stone carving is arising to
          meet this need. Most modern carving is traditional-style, but some
          carvers are experimenting with contemporary designs. Interest is also
          renewing for using stone carving in modern wats. Modern carvings are
          typically made from Banteay Meanchey sandstone, though stone from
          Pursat and Kompong Thom is also used.

          The height of Cambodian traditional lacquerware was between the 12th
          and 16th centuries; some examples of work from this era, including
          gilded Buddha images and betel boxes, have survived to the present
          day. Lacquerware was traditionally colored black using burnt wood,
          representing the underworld; red using mercury, representing the
          earth; and yellow using arsenic, representing the heavens. Lacquer on
          Angkorian stone dates to the 15th or 16 century.
        </p>

        <p>
          In modern Cambodia, the art of lacquerwork nearly faded into oblivion:
          few lacquer trees survived, and lacquer was unavailable in local
          markets. Today's revival is still in its infancy, but 100 lacquer
          artists have been trained by a French expert under the guidance of
          Artisans d'Angkor, a company that produces traditional crafts in
          village workshops. Some artists are "beginning to experiment with
          different techniques and styles...to produce modern and striking

          Silversmithing in Cambodia dates back centuries. The Royal Palace
          traditionally patronized silversmiths' workshops, and silversmiths
          remain concentrated at Kompong Luong, near the former royal capital
          Oudong. Silver was made into a variety of items, including weaponry,
          coins, ceremonial objects used in funerary and religious rituals, and
          betel boxes. During Cambodia's colonial period, artisans at the School
          of Fine Art produced celebrated silverwork, and by the late 1930s
          there were more than 600 silversmiths. Today, silverwork is popular
          for boxes, jewellery, and souvenir items; these are often adorned with
          fruit, fire, and Angkor-inspired motifs. Men produce most of the forms
          for such work, but women often complete the intricate filigree.

          Cambodian pottery traditions date to 5000 BCE. Ceramics were mostly
          used for domestic purposes such as holding food and water. There is no
          evidence that Khmer ceramics were ever exported, though ceramics were
          imported from elsewhere in Asia beginning in the 10th century.
          Ceramics in the shape of birds, elephants, rabbits, and other animals
          were popular between the 11th and 13th centuries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Potting traditionally was done either on a pottery wheel or using
          shaping tools such as paddles and anvils. Firing was done in clay
          kilns, which could reach temperatures of 1,000–1,200 °C, or in the
          open air, at temperatures of around 700 °C. Primarily green and brown
          glazes were used. In rural Cambodia, traditional pottery methods
          remained. Many pieces are hand-turned and fired on an open fire
          without glaze. The country's major center for pottery is Kompong
          Chhnang Province.
        </p>

        <p>
          In modern Cambodia, the art of glazed ceramics faded into oblivion:
          the technique of stoneware stops to be used around 14th century, at
          the end of Angkor era. Today this technique begins a slow revival
          through a Belgian ceramist who founded the Khmer Ceramics & Fine Arts
          Center, in Siem Reap, the organization lead vocational training and
          researches about this lost skill.
